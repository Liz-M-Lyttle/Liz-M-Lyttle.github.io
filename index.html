<p> I ridden horses at Hidden "K" Stables for five years. I ride english in general but focus on Dressage.</p>
<p>My favorite horse is Prince of Whales. He's a bay, Welsh/Quarter mix, and stands at 10.2 hands. He's formally trained in dressage and jumps very well.</p>

<h4>I am an A/B honor role student and I'm interested in the STEM career field.</h4>
<p>I have three colleges in mind, UNC at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State, or Wake Forest University.</p>
<p>I am most interested in either a biochem or biotech career. I hope to either be working to solve genetic diseases or t find new, clean sources and power mechanics.</p>
