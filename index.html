<p> Oh hello, haha. I love what I do and I'll never stop.</p>
<p>I am a part-time employee at Tiger Kim's Clemmons location, I teach Little Tiger, White-belt and Yellow-belt classes on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>I'm also a new member of Tiger Kim's 2015 Demo Team. This year we'll be performing at events from local to international scale.</p>
<p> I ridden horses at Hidden "K" Stables for five years. I ride english in general but focus on Dressage.</p>
<p>My favorite horse would be Prince of Whales. He's a bay, Welsh/Quarter mix, and stands at 10.2 hands. He's formally trained in dressage and jumps very well.</p>
<p> I was a gymnast at Salem Gymnastics since age four. I competed on the AAU team from level 3 to level 5.</p>
